/*
* There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting to be executed.
* The counting begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise).
* In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds
* around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the
* last person remains, who is given freedom.

* Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and
* kth person is killed in circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that
* you are the last one remaining and so survive.

    Example 1:

    Input:
    n = 2, k = 1
    Output:
    2
    Explanation:
    Here, n = 2 and k = 1, then safe position is
    2 as the person at 1st position will be killed.

    Example 2:

    Input:
    n = 4, k = 2
    Output:
    1
    Explanation:
    The safe position is 1.
